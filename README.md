I learned that Slack is a messaging app designed for business. It provides organised workspaces that allow users to efficiently drive projects forward, share ideas, set deadlines and make decisions together.

As well, Slack's flexibility allows users to be productive according to their personal habits, enable real-time collaboration, access company-wide information, and create focused work time.

In addition, Slack serves as a platform that connects all colleagues inside and outside the company, facilitating better communication and ensuring that everyone stays on top of what's going on at work. Overall, Slack strives to provide a collaborative and organised workspace that encourages users to change the way they work and enhance their work experience.

I learnt about project management with Trello and I learnt how to add task cards and use the drag and drop feature to sort lists and move tasks around. In addition, I learnt about adding descriptions, checklists, labels, deadlines and attachments to card details for more comprehensive task tracking.
